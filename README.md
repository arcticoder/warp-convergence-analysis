# warp-convergence-analysis

Performs a convergence sweep of your warp-solver by invoking the baseline validation harness at multiple Δr values, fits observed orders, and emits a LaTeX report.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.7+  
- numpy  

## Inputs

- `run_validation.py`  
  (from https://github.com/arcticoder/warp-solver-validation)  
- `generate_solver_equations.py` from https://github.com/arcticoder/warp-solver-equations

## Repository Structure

```markdown
## Usage

1. **Run convergence sweep**  
   ```bash
   python convergence_analysis.py
```

By default, it steps through `h = [0.1, 0.05, 0.025, 0.0125]` and populates `convergence.tex`.
    

## Customization

-   Adjust grid spacings by editing the `hs` list in `convergence_analysis.py`.
    
-   Parse additional test cases by extending the `tests` array and adapting the regex extractor.
